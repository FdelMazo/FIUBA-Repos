This is a modification of the incredible [react-gh-repo-cards](https://github.com/CITIZENDOT/react-gh-repo-cards) by @CITIZENDOT, to avoid doing one API call per card, and directly allow passing down the response data through a React prop, as to make this site get eeeverything it needs on the first API call, and then simply propagate it during it's run.
